lcOpenInviterPlugin 
===================

The `lcOpenInviterPlugin` is a symfony plugin that allows users to grab their contacts from different __e-mail providers (gmail, hotmail, yahoo ...)__ and __social sites (facebook, twitter, hi5 ...)__ then send them e-mails and messages.

__The total of available providers and social sites is more than 86__

This plugin is developed by [LetsCod](http://www.letscod.com/ "Your web projects experts : Symfony, PHP, MySQL, PostgreSQL, jQuery").

Server Requirements
-------------------
  * CURL extension for php
  * DOM Element support for php

_If you're on windows OS, you should create an empty folder "tmp" for cookie storage. (for example, if you're using wamp, create the folder C:\tmp)_

Plugin Requirements
-------------------
Get a username and private key (both required for the installation task) by signing up in [www.openinviter.com](http://www.openinviter.com/ "Import contacts").

It's quick and easy.

Installation
------------

  * Install the plugin

        $ symfony plugin:install --stability=beta lcOpenInviterPlugin

  * Publish the plugin assets (css and js):

        $ symfony plugin:publish-assets

  * Clear you cache

        $ symfony cc

  
Configuring your plugin
-----------------------

  * Configure the plugin by running the plugin task:

        $ symfony open-inviter:install --username=your-username  --key=your-private-key

  * example:
  
        $ symfony open-inviter:install --username=elieandraos  --key=ee7968edc9580e1578c6bd7ad54fad4a
        
        
this task sets the username and private key you entered and checks your sever configuration (php version, curl
installation, DOM Element installation, cookie path ...)
if everything is okay, a log file will be written.

_make sure to enter the right username and key because it's not yet validated with openinviter servers_
        
        
  * Enable the module and helper in your application `settings.yml` 

            [yml]
            all:
              .settings:
                enabled_modules:      [openInviter]
                standard_helpers:     [openInviter]
                

  * Configure the e-mail text and providers in your application `app.yml`

            [yml]
            all:
              lcOpenInviter:
                wish-list:
                  providers: ["hotmail","gmail", "aol", "facebook", "flickr", "hi5","indiatimes", "operamail", "tagged", "yahoo"]
                message:
                  subject: "is inviting you to join letscod developers"
                  body: "Check our recruitment page"
                  footer: "LetsCod"

The user wishlist
-----------------
                  
  * If the wish list is not set, a default wish list of "Gmail, hotmail and yahoo" is provided

  * If the wishlist is set to `all`, it will return all the available providers  

            [yml]
            all:
              lcOpenInviter:
                wish-list:
                  providers: [all]
                                    
Displaying the form
-------------------
     
            [php]
            <? 
              echo link_to("invite", "openInviterHome");

The Auto-updates
----------------
  As each service and provider updates their url of getting contacts for their own security reasons, a task has been created
  to do update the plugin's classes.
  
        $ symfony open-inviter:auto-update
  
  _`You can run this task manually to get the updates, but the best way would be to make a cronjob that runs this task twice a day 
   (every 12 hours) for the perfect balance between server load and autoupdate frequency.`_
